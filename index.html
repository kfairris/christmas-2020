                    <h2>The Fairris Family</h2>
                    <p><strong>2020 has been a different kind of year hasn't it?</strong></p>
                    <p>March led to the ending of
                        Alee's
                        work and the start of virtual school for the kids. Kenny's office closed so he has been working
                        from
                        home since March. It has been a big adjustment for all of us. Alee and the kids faced challenges
                        adapting to virtual school, but they found a groove and made it through the spring. We found a
                        new
                        pool to join this summer since our regular one didn't open, and it was a blessing to our family.
                    </p>
                    <p>We've seen grandparents a little this year, but not as often as we would like to. We were
                        thankful
                        for the kids to get to go to school in person this fall. The kids have excelled after being back
                        at
                        school with friends, and it has been good for us as a family to have a little bit of normalcy.
                    </p>

                    <p>Emma started 6th grade and middle school. She's taking dance and has started playing clarinet in
                        the school band. Middle school classes have been challenging, but she's adapting well. She
                        continues
                        to love to read, and she usually has several books going at the same time. She's a sweet and
                        loyal
                        friend, and her younger brothers drive her crazy sometimes.</p>

                        He started little league this fall, and he experienced new frustations and challenges. His
                        favorite
                        subject is math, and he loves playing outside. He is our coordinated sports kid, and we love

                        brother
                        in the same school. Parents are not allowed inside the building because of COVID, so it's been a
                        blessing that Grant can walk him to class every day. He played soccer with a friend this fall
                        and
                        had a great time. He and Grant are great buddies and wrestling partners.</p>

                    <h2>Kenny and Alee</h2>
                    <p>Alee is continuing to do contract OT work. In the spring she was working at three different
                        locations
                        until COVID shut everything down. This fall, she is working four days a week at a small private
                        school run by Easter Seals. She still enjoys OT and making a difference in kids' lives. We're
                        thankful for the hours she's been able to find.</p>
                    <p>Kenny still has a job with FamilyLife until August 2021. We have decided not to move to Orlando
                        with
                        FamilyLife, so he has used this time to train for a front-end web developer job. We'd appreciate
                        your prayers in this and will begin serious job hunting in January.</p>

                        definitely
                        the one God had for us. He gets really excited with new people, but he's sweet with the kids and
                        family. He's learned that the kids like to be licked, but momma doesn't. He likes to be rubbed
                        under
                        his chin. He can be a handful, but we're thankful for him.</p>
